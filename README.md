|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| users         | One-to-Many → applications, documents            |
| roles         | Many-to-Many → users (via role_user pivot)       |
| students      | One-to-One with users, One-to-Many → documents   |
| departments   | One-to-Many → courses, students                  |
| courses       | Belongs to departments                           |
| applications  | Belongs to students and courses                  |
